# Sideloading Source

An unofficial repository source for [Mangayomi](https://github.com/kodjodevf/mangayomi).

It will automatically stay up-to-date via. a GitHub workflow action that polls the main repo each day.  
This repo does not rehost releases. Instead it fetches the direct `.ipa` link and inserts new entries into [apps.json](apps.json)

Currently it supports [Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather) and [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/).  
It may work with [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) - but it has not been tested as I do not use it ðŸ˜…

## Features

- [x] Displays new releases within 24hrs
- [x] Files are direct links to the GitHub repo
- [x] News banners and captions vary between minor and patch versions
- [x] Provides version and formatted date in the news title for readability
- [x] Automatically purges old releases if they are removed from the main repo
- [ ] Missing something? Let me know!

## Credit

Thank you to [Balackburn](https://github.com/Balackburn) for their Apollo AltStore source implementation which was used to inform this one.
