# Sideloading Source

This is an unofficial repo source for Mangayomi.

It will automatically stay up-to-date via. a GitHub workflow action that polls the main repository.

Currently it only supports [Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather), as I have yet to determine the exact entitlements and privacy provisions required for AltStore [compatibility](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source#app-permissions).

## Credit

Big thanks to [Balackburn](https://github.com/Balackburn) for their [Apollo AltStore source](https://github.com/Balackburn/Apollo) which was used as a template for this one.
